#Abstract:
Beginning in March of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 quickly swept the nation, leaving many unanswered questions about how the virus affects the population regarding work and school. This project intends to explore how education in children from September 30th of 2020 to March 29th of 2021 is impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and create a comparative representation of influenzaâ€™s impact on child education from 2018 to 2019. The project will be carried out using data sets collected from KidsCount and the CDC along with a visual representation of the data that will answer questions about the SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on education and how it is distributed in students ages 6-17. We will explore changes in how students received education when SARS-CoV-2 started and absences due to illness or injury prior to the virus and the impact of quarantine on those students. This project will give us a better understanding of how education is affected during a large pandemic and start conversations about improving education during uncertain times.
